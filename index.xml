      <description>Well hello there. What&amp;rsquo;s going on here? Well I&amp;rsquo;m trying my hand at blogging, again&amp;hellip;
This time I&amp;rsquo;m using GoHugo as the framework with the Mainroad theme, hosted on GitHub Pages. There&amp;rsquo;s some funky GitHub automation stuff going on in the background which (I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest) I don&amp;rsquo;t entirely understand yet, having been very kindly given a 101 on what to do by my friend and erstwhile colleague, Piero Mamberti. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll get around to writing it up at some point.</description>

      <description>Hi there, I&amp;rsquo;m William. Nice to meet you.   Me with my back to where the opening battle in &amp;lsquo;Gladiator&amp;rsquo; was filmed. They chased the Barbarians into the treeline in the background.
  I&amp;rsquo;m a Mac geek, currently running the macOS estate in an enterprise organisation but for the past 25 years I&amp;rsquo;ve done macOS stuff at pretty much every level, from small MSPs up to where I am now.</description>
