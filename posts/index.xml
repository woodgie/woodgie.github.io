      <description>So like a lot of geeks, at home I run my own DNS (bind &amp;amp; PiHole) as well as using &amp;lsquo;professional&amp;rsquo; networking kit (UniFi) as well as having a couple of Mac Minis running as ESXi servers (I&amp;rsquo;m too cheap to pay for it, so no vSphere for me just plain old ESXi 7) as well as having&amp;hellip;

I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll get around to writing it up at some point.</description>
